VetCove cannot pay you for any sold items until a payout method is
selected. You can either be paid through a direct deposit into a bank
account, or we can mail a check to you. We attached the items you have
sold below that have not currently been paid out.

If you are having trouble entering a payout method, don't hesitate to
get in contact with us.
