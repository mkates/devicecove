			<h3>VetCove Mission</h3>
			<p>When upgrades take place, fully functional instruments are often traded in, put into permanent storage, or discarded.  These are instruments that can be used by price-conscious veterinarians in high-need markets across the country.  Furthermore, veterinary suppliers often have refurbished, traded in or lightly-used inventory that does not easily find its way into the hands of veterinarians who need them.
			We’re here to ensure that veterinarians across the United States have access to cost-effective and high-quality devices and instruments for their practices and hospitals.  More instruments in the hands of more veterinarians means more animal lives can be improved every day.  We’re proud to be helping our fellow veterinarians do their jobs better.
				If you have devices that cannot be sold, or that would like to donate to someone in need, we will facilitate the placement of your device to a charity or organization in need at our expense. </p>

			<h3>The Story behind the Service</h3>
			<p>In early 2013, Dr. Eric Kates, DVM wanted to upgrade his x-ray machine to a digital radiograph system in order to provide the highest quality imaging for his clients.  In doing so, he had no use for his 5-year-old x-ray machine, which was in perfect working condition and still had considerable value. In speaking with suppliers for new equipment, many offered to take the old machine off his hands for free or for a small trade-in fee, but nowhere could he get a fair market value for his machine, and nowhere could he be ensured it would make it into the hands of a practicing veterinarian rather than being placed in storage.  He explored trying to sell the machine online, but nowhere on the web could he find a trustworthy services that reached the veterinary community.  VetCove was born to create an easy-to-use web service for certified veterinarians and their trusted partners to buy and sell equipment.
			Often veterinarians replace an expensive piece of equipment such as a digital ultrasound and keep the old one as a backup or “just in case”.  It is relegated to the back storage room, never to be used again and year after year loses value.  It stays there until the practice owner finds it or it becomes an antique with relatively little value. This is the valuable things that Vetcove is all about.
