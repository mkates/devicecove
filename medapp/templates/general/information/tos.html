	<h5 class="content-title">Introduction</h5>
	<div class="question">
		<p>This User Agreement, the VetCove Privacy Policy, and all policies posted on our sites set out the terms on which VetCove offers you access to and use of our sites, services, applications and tools (collectively "Services"). All policies and the VetCove Privacy Policy are incorporated into this User Agreement. You agree to comply with all the above when accessing and using our Services.</p>
		<p>The entity you are contracting with is TheCove, LLC., 10 Pacer Court, Colts Neck, NJ if you reside in the United States. This User Agreement is effective upon acceptance for users who accept it through registration of an VetCove account or other electronic click-through on or after January 1st, 2014.</p>
		<p>Please be advised that this User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability and Legal Disputes provisions below). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")). Unless you opt-out: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</p>

	<h5 class="content-title">About VetCove</h5>
	<div class="question">
		<p>VetCove is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything related to the Veterinary and medical industries in a variety of pricing formats and locations. As a marketplace, VetCove does not own or sell the items listed on this site, so the actual contract for sale is directly between the sellers and buyers. VetCove is not a traditional auctioneer.  </p>
		<p>While we may provide pricing, shipping, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may choose not to follow it. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, VetCove has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>

<div class="infobox vetbox">
	<h5 class="content-title">Fees</h5>
	<div class="question">
		<p>The fees we charge for using our Services are as follows:</p>
		<p>While we may provide pricing, shipping, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may choose not to follow it. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, VetCove has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>9.4% of the item's listed price at the time of listing, as set by the seller, regardless of the actual sale amount. </li>
			<li>All credit card fees incurred by VetCove during the transaction for items bought and sold online through VetCove, which can be up to 2.9% of the item's listed price.</li>
			<li>Note that in rare cases where we determine that the actual sale price of an in-person transaction of a VetCove listed item is substantially higher (20% or more) than the price listed, VetCove reserves the right to collect 9.4% of the actual value of the sale, rather than the listed price.</li>
			<li>Note that volume sellers such as verified suppliers, distributors, or manufacturers may be eligible for reduced commission rates as negotiated between the selling party and the VetCove team. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>We may change our fees from time to time by posting the changes on the VetCove site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions.</p>
		<p>You must have a payment method on file when selling on VetCove, except in cases where payment from the buyer will be held in escrow directly by VetCove and its partners, and thus commission will be collected directly by VetCove from the buyer's payment.  All VetCove sellers must pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. (This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts that are unresponsive 90 days beyond a list date that VetCove believes has resulted in a transaction without paid commission, direct charge of the seller's credit card or bank account. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. VetCove, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report or company's business history. If you wish to dispute the information VetCove reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at VetCove Inc., C/O Global Collections, 10 Pacer Court, Colts Neck, NJ 07722. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your VetCove account, you must contact the collection agency directly.</p>

	<h5 class="content-title">Listing Conditions</h5>
	<div class="question">
		<p>When listing an item, you agree to comsection-containerply with rules for listing and Selling Practices policy and that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are responsible for the accuracy and content of the listing and item offered.
			<li>Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). VetCove can't guarantee exact listing durations.
			<li>We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;
				<li>item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;
				<li>seller's history, seller ratings, and feedback; and
				<li>number of listings matching the buyer's query.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Accordingly, to drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer.  </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on certain Services.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item either online or in person.

		</ul>
		<p>Many of our Services are accessible to international sellers and buyers. We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items, as well as the legality of importing an item into a juristication.  Sellers will not be responsible for refunds or return shipping on an item that needs to be returned because it is not legal in the juristiction for which it is being shipped.</p>
		<p>To assist users who may speak different languages, we may translate listings and other user and/or VetCove content, in whole or part, into other languages. If you are a buyer, we also may provide you with access to tools so you can request an on-demand translation of certain content on our sites, such as parts of a listing or a message from an VetCove user. The accuracy or availability of the translation resulting from such on-demand translation is not guaranteed.</p>

		<p>You agree to receive calls, including autodialed and/or pre-recorded message calls, from VetCove at any of the telephone numbers (including mobile telephone numbers) that we have collected for you as authorized and described in our Privacy Policy, including telephone numbers you have provided us, or that we have obtained from third parties or collected by our own efforts. If the telephone number that we have collected is a mobile telephone number, you consent to receive SMS or other text messages at that number. Standard telephone minute and text charges may apply if we contact you at a mobile number or device. You agree we may contact you in the manner described above at the telephone numbers we have in our records for these purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To contact you for reasons relating to your account or your use of our Services (such as to collect a debt, resolve a dispute, or to otherwise enforce our User Agreement) or as authorized by applicable law</li>
			<li>To contact you for marketing, promotional, or other reasons that you have either previously consented to or that you may be asked to consent to in the future. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you can opt-out in the communications preference section of your Account Settings.</li>

	<h5 class="content-title">Additional Terms</h5>
	<div class="question">
		<h4>Returns</h4>
		<p>VetCove offers a returns process to simplify returns for buyers and sellers. With the VetCove returns process, a seller accepting returns can manage and track the return through an automated process on the site. There is no fee to use the VetCove returns process. If the buyer returns an item because it does not match the listing description, sellers will generally be responsible for return shipping costs. VetCove may automatically apply the VetCove returns process to listings where returns are accepted. Sellers may remove the VetCove returns process from their listings by adjusting their account settings.  Sellers are not obligated to accept returns after the stated period of five business days, but may choose to do so in accordance with their own return policies.  However, in cases where an item is not functioning as intended, or was not received as described as to indicate the item was misrepresented in the listing, VetCove may, in its sole discretion, authorize a return beyond the stated retun period at the seller's expense.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">	
		<h4>VetCove Buyer Protection</h4>
		<p>If a seller is required to reimburse the buyer or VetCove for an VetCove Buyer Protection case, the seller authorizes VetCove to remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency). The seller is required to have a valid payment method on file. If there are insufficient funds in the escrow account, the seller authorizes VetCove to charge any reimbursement amount owed to the payment method on file. We may also place the reimbursement amount on the seller's invoice. If seller does not provide VetCove with a valid payment method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.</p>
		<p>We may suspend the VetCove Buyer Protection policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.</p>

		<p>In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold VetCove responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:</p>

Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<h4>Applicable Law</h4>
		<p>You agree that the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and VetCove, except as otherwise stated in the User Agreement.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">	
		<h4>Agreement to Arbitrate</h4>
		<p>You and VetCove each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and VetCove relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to VetCove's Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through VetCove's Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
		<div class="sub-question">
			<h4>Arbitration Procedures</h4>
			<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.</p>
			<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or User Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
			<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at http://www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of the completed form to us at the following address to initiate arbitration proceedings: VetCove, LLC. 10 Pacer Court, Colts Neck, NJ 07722. </p>
			<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or VetCove may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and VetCove subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or VetCove, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
			<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different VetCove users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same VetCove user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-question">
			<h4>Costs of Arbitration</h4>
			<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, VetCove will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by VetCove should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and VetCove will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, VetCove will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse VetCove for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by VetCove on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-question">
			<h4>Severability</h4>
			<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>
